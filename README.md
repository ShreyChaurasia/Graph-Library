# Graph-Library

This is a full-fledged library for all the basic functions of graphs. Using this, you can create weight/Unweighted directed and undirected graphs.

There are wide functions available
1) addEdge(x,y,w) adds an edge to the graph with weight w. 
2) isCyclic() detects if there is a cycle in the graph.
3) getNumOfConnectedComponents() - returns the number of connected components. 
4) is Bipartite() tells if a graph is bipartite and returns the number of strongly connected components.
5) getNumOf StronglyConnectedComponents()
6) isTree() - tells if a given graph is a tree or not.
7) bfs traversal of a tree. 
8) dfs traversal of a tree.
9) getNumberOfNodes()
10 getNumberOfEdges()
